    "Dropout makes our big network act like a little one by randomly training little subsections of the network at a time, and little networks don't overfit.\n",

    "Dropput is actually a form of training a bunch of networks and averaging them.\n",

    "Nerual networks,even tough they are randomly generated, still start by learning the biggest, most broad sweeping features before learning much about the noise.\n"
